# Trimpics

Pictographic and more compact UI for Trimps

# What is this

I'm playing trimps on a 15-inch laptop, on Linux. This ~cursed~ combo makes the game UI look kinda
janky, and it doesn't even fit the screen properly.

Moreover, I'm fond of various icons in this game, so I've added *even more* icons for Buildings, Jobs, and Equipment.

# How to install

Get [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), install
the [userscript](https://github.com/livercat/Trimpics/raw/main/trimpics.user.js).

# Compatibility

Tested exclusively on Firefox 98+ and Kubuntu 21.

On the other hand, it's pure CSS, so should work with any browser and any other Trimps userscripts (I personally use
AutoTrimps with Trimpics).

Anyway, if you find a bug, please file an issue, I'll look into it.

Take care if you're under z100, there are slight spoilers (but icons only, no text)
