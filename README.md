# Trimpictionary
Pictographic and more compact UI for Trimps

# What is this
I'm playing trimps on a 15-inch laptop, on Linux. This c͕̼̝u̫̱̙r͉͉̪̜̫͓s̯͚̱͓e̹d̟̺ combo makes the game UI look kinda janky, and it doesn't even fit the screen properly.

Moreover, I'm fond of various icons in this game, so I've added *even more* icons for Buildings, Jobs, and Equipment.

# How to install
Get [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), install the [userscript](https://github.com/livercat/Trimpictionary/blob/main/trimpictionary.user.js).

# Compatibility
Tested exclusively on Firefox 98+ and Kubuntu 21.

On the other hand, it's pure CSS, so should work with any browser and any other Trimps userscripts (I personally use AutoTrimps with Trimpictionary).

Anyway, if you find a bug, please file an issue, I'll look into it.
